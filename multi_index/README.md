# multi_index

`multi_index` started out life as a fork of
[lun3x/multi_index_map](https://github.com/lun3x/multi_index_map) with the
intention to resubmit upstream.

As time passed by it has become less and less like the original, and is
fundamentally no longer compatible due to a different api, parts were replaced
by darling, etc. and it has been split into `multi_index` and
`multi_index_derive`.

:warning: Warning!

This fork is intended for usage with insim.rs and patina specifically and as
such it's api, features and implementation should be considered absolutely
unstable.

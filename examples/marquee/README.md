# marquee

A silly painted letter marquee.

Run executable with "where-the-fuck-i-am" as an argument.
Copy output and run `marquee $OUTPUTHERE "your text"`

To turn this into a fully functional, standalone app it needs:

1. A config file
2. Support for both letterboards and painted text at the same time (it's hard coded for
   one or the other)
3. Support for multiple locations through the configuration file

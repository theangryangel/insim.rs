# insim.rs

A collection of crates to assist working with the [Live For Speed](https://lfs.net/) racing simulator and it's [Insim](https://en.lfsmanual.net/wiki/InSim.txt) (protocol).

For the foreseeable future only TCP is supported for simplicity and time.
Outsim is currently not supported.

:warning: The API is not yet 100% stable at this time. Use at your own risk.

| `multi_index` and `multi_index_derive` | `multi_index` started out life as a fork of [lun3x/multi_index_map](https://github.com/lun3x/multi_index_map) with the intention to resubmit upstream. See multi_index/README.md for more information. |
| `patina`                               | An incomplete application that uses `insim` under the hood. Mostly used to test `insim`.                                                                                                               |

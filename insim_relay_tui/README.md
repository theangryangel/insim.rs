# tui

This is a bad example of how to use the insim library in a tui application. It was largely used to
use the library in a more real world scenario to ensure that we are functional and the library is
vaguely ergonomic.

It was quickly hacked together over multiple evenings/early mornings and contains a whole bunch of
"quick fixes" and inefficiencies that I will /totally/ at some point revisit.
